    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This project uses data from the temporary voluntary scheme set up by the
    CMA, where retailers publish recent pricing data. You can find out more
    about that
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/access-fuel-price-data">here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>You can read more about the CMA's monitoring of the fuel market, including
    the future launch of Fuel Finder
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/road-fuel-price-data-scheme">here</a>.</p>

    <p>This website was inspired by
    <a href="https://www.petrolprices.com">PetrolPrices.com</a> and
    <a href="https://bustimes.org/">bustimes.org</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>FAQs</h3>
    <h5>Why aren't all petrol stations on the map?</h5>
    <p>Only petrol stations participating in the voluntary scheme are available.
    You can find participating retailers and links to their data
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/access-fuel-price-data">here</a>.</p>
    <p>You might find more petrol stations on
    <a href="https://www.petrolprices.com">PetrolPrices.com</a>.</p>

    <h5>Are the prices accurate?</h5>
    <p>Only data provided by retailers as part of the voluntary scheme are used.
    Neither the CMA nor I check the accuracy of the data. No other data such as
    crowd sourced data is used.</p>

    <h5>Why are you using 'E10' and 'SDV' codes for the fuel type picker?</h5>
    <p>The fuel picker is dynamically created based on the fuel types listed by
    retailers in the data they provide. E10 is standard petrol, and B7 is
    standard diesel. E10 is selected by default.</p>
