    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This project uses data from the temporary voluntary scheme set up by the
    CMA, where retailers publish recent pricing data. You can find out more
    about that
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/access-fuel-price-data">here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>You can read more about the CMA's monitoring of the fuel market, including
    the future launch of Fuel Finder
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/road-fuel-price-data-scheme">here</a>.</p>

    <p>This website was inspired by
    <a href="https://www.petrolprices.com">PetrolPrices.com</a> and
    <a href="https://bustimes.org/">bustimes.org</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>FAQs</h3>
    <h5>Why aren't all petrol stations on the map?</h5>
    <p>Only petrol stations participating in the voluntary scheme are available.
    You can find participating retailers and links to their data
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/access-fuel-price-data">here</a>.</p>
    <p>You might find more petrol stations on
    <a href="https://www.petrolprices.com">PetrolPrices.com</a>.</p>

    <h5>Are the prices accurate?</h5>
    <p>Only data provided by retailers as part of the voluntary scheme are used.
    Neither the CMA nor I check the accuracy of the data. No other data such as
    crowd sourced data is used.</p>

    <h5>Why are you using 'E10' and 'SDV' codes for the fuel type picker?</h5>
    <p>Because it's what's used in the data provided by retailers, and it's
    shorter ☺. E10 is standard petrol, and B7 is standard diesel. E10 is
    selected by default.</p>
