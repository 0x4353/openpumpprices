    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This project uses data from the temporary voluntary scheme set up by the
    CMA, where retailers publish recent pricing data. You can find out more
    about that
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/access-fuel-price-data">here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>You can read more about the CMA's monitoring of the fuel market, including
    the future launch of Fuel Finder
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/road-fuel-price-data-scheme">here</a>.</p>

    <p>This website was inspired by
    <a href="https://www.petrolprices.com">PetrolPrices.com</a> and
    <a href="https://bustimes.org/">bustimes.org</a>.</p>

    <h3>FAQs</h3>
    <h5>Why aren't all petrol stations on the map?</h5>
    <p>Only petrol stations participating in the voluntary scheme are available.
    You can find participating retailers and links to their data
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/access-fuel-price-data">here</a>.</p>
    <p>You might find more petrol stations on
    <a href="https://www.petrolprices.com">PetrolPrices.com</a>.</p>

    <h5>Are the prices accurate?</h5>
    <p>Only data provided by retailers as part of the voluntary scheme are used.
    Neither the CMA nor I check the accuracy of the data. No other data such as
    crowd sourced data is used.</p>

    <h5>What does the Refresh Data button do?</h5>
    <p>Fuel price data is fetched by your browser and stored in the local
    storage. On new page loads, the cached data in local storage is used for
    the next day. The Refresh Data button invalidates the cache and reloads
    the page, forcing teh data to be re-fetched. Given source prices are
    typically updated daily, it shouldn't usually be necessary to use this
    button.</p>

    <h5>Why are you using 'E10' and 'SDV' codes for the fuel type picker?</h5>
    <p>Because it's what's used in the data provided by retailers, and it's
    shorter ☺. E10 is standard petrol, and B7 is standard diesel. E10 is
    selected by default.</p>

    <h5>Where are my favourites stored?</h5>
    <p>Your list of favourites is stored in your browsers local storage. If you
    use incognito mode, or delete this websites cookies and site data in brower
    settings, your favourites will be deleted. There are no accounts, and your
    favourites are not stored on this websites servers.</p>
